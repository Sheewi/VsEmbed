## 4. Best Practices Implementation

### Incremental Modifications Approach

#### Small, Focused Changes
- Each PR addresses a single concern
- Maximum 500 lines of code per change
- Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- Detailed commit messages with rationale

#### Example Change Structure
```
feat(security): Add container signature validation

- Implements cosign-based container verification
- Adds trusted registry allowlist
- Provides fallback for development environments
- Includes comprehensive error handling

Addresses: Security requirement #SR-001
Testing: Unit tests (95% coverage) + integration tests
Rollback: Feature flag CONTAINER_SIGNING_ENABLED
```

### Strategic Changes with Safety Nets

#### Feature Flags for Major Changes
```typescript
// Strategic change with safety net
if (featureFlags.hybridModelManager) {
  // New hybrid model manager
  await hybridModelManager.initialize();
} else {
  // Legacy model system
  await legacyModelManager.initialize();
}
```

#### Monitoring and Alerting
```typescript
// Change impact monitoring
const changeMetrics = {
  performanceImpact: measurePerformanceChange(),
  errorRateChange: measureErrorRateChange(),
  userSatisfaction: measureUserSatisfaction(),
  securityPosture: measureSecurityImprovement()
};

if (changeMetrics.errorRateChange > 0.05) {
  await alerting.sendAlert('Change impact detected', changeMetrics);
  await rollback.considerAutomatic();
}
```

### Adoption Monitoring Through Telemetry

#### Privacy-Respecting Analytics
```typescript
// Anonymous usage telemetry
const telemetryData = {
  feature: 'hybridModelManager',
  event: 'modelSwitch',
  success: true,
  duration: 2.5, // seconds
  hardwareProfile: 'standard',
  timestamp: Date.now(),
  sessionId: anonymousSessionId
};

if (userConsent.telemetryEnabled) {
  await telemetry.send(telemetryData);
}
```
